There are n floors in BH3 and only 2 lifts. Initially Lift A is at the ground floor and Lift B at the top floor. Whenever someone calls the lift from N th floor, the lift closest to that floor comes to pick him up. If both the lifts are at equidistant from the N th floor, them the lift from the lower floor comes up.

INPUT

First line contains a integer T denoting the number of test cases.

Next T lines contains a single integer N denoting the floor from which lift is called.

OUTPUT

Output T lines containing one character "A" if the first lift goes to N th floor or "B" for the second lift.

CONTRAINTS

0 <= N <= n

1 <= T <= 100000

Explanation
3rd floor calls, Lift A(0) goes there.

5th  floor calls, Lift A(3) and Lift B(7) are equidistant from 5, so Lift from lowest floor goes there i.e. A.
